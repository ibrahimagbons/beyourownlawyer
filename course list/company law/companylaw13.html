<p class="h5 font-weight-bold">WINDING UP BY THE COURT</p>
<p class="text-justify">Winding up, also known as liquidation, is the process through which a company's existence is brought to an end. The assets of the company are collected and sold to pay its debts, and any surplus is distributed among the shareholders. In Nigeria, the winding-up process is governed by the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020. <i>See the case of Olufosoye v. Fakorede (1993) 1 NWLR (Pt. 272) 747 and the case of Kano State Oil and Allied Products Ltd. v. Kofa Trading Co. Ltd. (1996) 3 NWLR (Pt. 436) 244.</i> Under Section 572 of CAMA 2020, a company may be wound up by the court under the following circumstances:<br>
<ol class="text-justify">
    <li><strong>Inability to pay debts:</strong> this happens if a company is unable to pay its debts, it can be wound up. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if a creditor, to whom the company owes a sum exceeding ₦200,000, has served a demand for payment, and the company fails to pay within three weeks, execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree, or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, it is proven to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts.</li>

    <li><strong>Failure to commence business:</strong> this happens if the company does not commence its business within a year of its incorporation, or suspends its business for a whole year.</li>
</ol></p>

<p class="h5 font-weight-bold">PROCEDURE FOR WINDING UP BY THE COURT</p>
<p class="text-justify"><ol class="text-justify">
